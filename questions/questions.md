*Question 1*

Subject:  Bad design

Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Thanks,
Marissa

Hi Marissa,

Thank you so much for your feedback, and I completely understand your frustration. I'm really sorry to hear that the new design has made it harder for you to clear or delete indexes, especially when you're iterating quickly.

We're constantly working on improving the user experience, so your input is really valuable. I'll pass this on to our product team. In the meantime, if you'd like a faster way to clear or delete indexes, you might find using our API or the command-line interface (CLI) more efficient for those tasks.

Let me know if you'd like some guidance on using those tools!

Thanks again for sharing your thoughts,
Anthony

*Question 2*:

Subject: URGENT ISSUE WITH PRODUCTION!!!!

Since today 9:15am we have been seeing a lot of errors on our website. Multiple users have reported that they were unable to publish their feedbacks and that an alert box with "Record is too big, please contact enterprise@algolia.com".

Our website is an imdb like website where users can post reviews of coffee shops online. Along with that we enrich every record with a lot of metadata that is not for search. I am already a paying customer of your service, what else do you need to make your search work?

Please advise on how to fix this. Thanks.
